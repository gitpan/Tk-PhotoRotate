DESCRIPTION
       Tk::PhotoRotate is a Photo method that rotates an image by
       an arbitrary amount.  If 90, 180 or 270 degrees, then
       Tk::PhotoRotateSimple is used.

       Zero degrees is "north", 90 degrees is "west", 180 degrees
       is "south",  and 270 degrees is "east".

       Translated verbatim from Richard Suchenwirth's version on
       the Tcl-ers' Wiki.  With assistance from George Staplin
       and Donal Fellows.
